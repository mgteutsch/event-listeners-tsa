## Screenshots

## Description
Click anywhere on screen and either a right or left arrow will generate randomly. Really, it's not the best way to direct air traffic... but it's a good spontaneous road trip tool, I guess. Hop in the car, and at every intersection click the screen to see which way you should turn. 
<br/>
(Ok, yeah, that's not a good idea either.)

## How to Run
After pulling down the code, run the following in your Terminal:
```
http-server
```
and view the exercise in your browser.
